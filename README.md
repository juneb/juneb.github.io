# juneb.github.io

This is a test project that I'm using to learn Google Pages and Jekyll. 

I'm using these instructions: [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/ "https://pages.github.com/")

So, far, it's not working. When I type: 
	
	http://juneb.github.io

I get a 404. But, I'm determined, so stay tuned.
